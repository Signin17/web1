<h2>Corona</h2>
coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. <br>A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory  illness, <br>called COVID-19.
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
<img src="corona.jpg" width="100%">
<p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate<br> respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br> Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the<br> COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from<br> infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>

<p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the<br> nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also<br> practice respiratory etiquette </p>
